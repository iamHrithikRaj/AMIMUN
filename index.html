            The world continues to face the all-encompassing COVID-19 pandemic –
            a health crisis, economic disaster and human rights emergency rolled
            into one unprecedented challenge. We also confront a planetary
            emergency – including accelerating climate change, growing pollution
            and collapsing biodiversity – threatening the environment on which
            everyone’s future depends. <br />
            And we are witnessing an alarming spread of hatred and
            discrimination. <br />
            In these trying times, I welcome your engagement in the Model United
            Nations. Young people today are spearheading movements for climate
            action, racial justice, gender equality and so much more. <br />
            You are connecting on-line and in the streets, showing the power of
            collective action. The pandemic has created a moment for change.
            <br />
            Recovery is our chance to shape a better future. <br />
            And the Sustainable Development Goals are our roadmap. <br />
            The United Nations is committed to being your ally as we push to
            build a more sustainable and equitable world for people today and
            for generations to come. <br />
            Thank you for your belief in the power of dialogue and cooperation
            to meet the tests of our time. <br />

            Dear Delegate, Human history, especially the past two years, has
            been inundated with times of great sorrow and strife. Yet, we
            continue to march forward, forever continuing on towards the
            horizon. It is with this sentiment of determination, that I invite
            you to Amity International Model United Nations 2022 (AMIMUN’22).
            The 11th edition of the AMIMUN Conference will be held online from
            <b>Saturday, January 22nd to Sunday, January 23rd, 2022.</b> <br />

            Each iteration of AMIMUN has expanded upon its legacy with great
            success, from managing greater numbers each year, to ensuring global
            participation with our international delegates. We, as the
            secretariat of AMIMUN’22, are confident in our ability to stay true
            to tradition and bring to you an exceptional debating experience.
            Despite all that has transpired, we shall not be deterred-
            <b>“Perserverantia Omnia Vincit”.</b><br />
            AMIMUN’22 is the optimal platform for students across the world to
            display their fervor for debate through constructive discussion,
            while simultaneously enabling them to delve further into continuous
            changes occurring across the world. During this edition, we believe
            the agendas set will push delegates to truly reflect on the issues
            today, showing them just how vital it is to persevere above all. We
            look forward to seeing delegates flourish through this experience,
            and hope to aid in their path towards being diplomatic delegates,
            and also holistic young leaders. I would like to take this
            opportunity to thank our Founder President Sir, Chancellor Sir,
            Vice-Chancellor Ma’am, Faculty Coordinators, Partners, and Sponsors
            for their unabating support for AMIMUN'22, and for making this
            conference possible. On behalf of the secretariat, I extend a warm
            invitation to all delegates and hope this conference will be as
            productive for you as an individual, and as a delegate. Remember,
            <b>“Perserverantia Omnia Vincit”- perseverance conquers all</b>. I
            wish you all the very best.
            <br />

                Sagar Pictures is a well-known film and television production
                business. Sagar Pictures is a significant content producer for
                Indian television, feature films, and documentaries. Dr.
                Ramanand Sagar's world-famous Indian TV series based on the
                Ramayan introduced television to Indian households in 1987, and
                the company remains inspired by its legendary heritage but is
                propelled by a fresh contemporary vision, trendsetting Indian
                audio-visual content and production. <br />

                With Ramayana, the longest-running television epic, Sagar
                Pictures managed to create one of the biggest television
                sensations of the era. The broadcast, which was re-aired after
                33 years during the initial wave of the pandemic's lockdown,
                smashed all global records by becoming the most-watched
                entertainment programme on the planet. For the past 71 years,
                the production firm has been a cornerstone of Indian film,
                becoming a pioneer in the art of script and motion pictures.
                Other well-known Sagar picture series include Luv Kush, Shri
                Krishna, Aladdin, Meera, and many more. The company, which is
                widely recognised for bringing television into Indian
                households, is still propelled by its ancient origins and a
                modern vision and has managed to become a trendsetter in Indian
                audio-visual entertainment. <br />

                Education, Science, and Culture. UNESCO's programmes help to
                accomplish the Sustainable Development Goals outlined in Agenda
                2030, which was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly
                in 2015. Governments' political and economic frameworks are
                insufficient to assure the peoples' long-term and sincere
                support. Dialogue and mutual understanding must be the
                foundations of peace. In this spirit, UNESCO creates educational
                resources to assist people in living as global citizens who are
                free of hatred and intolerance. UNESCO strives to ensure that
                every child and citizen has access to a high-quality education.
                UNESCO strengthens national relationships by fostering cultural
                heritage and the equal dignity of all cultures. UNESCO promotes
                scientific programmes and policies as development and
                cooperation platforms. UNESCO advocates for free expression as a
                fundamental right and a prerequisite for democracy and
                development. The founding idea of UNESCO arose in response to a
                world war marred by racist and anti-Semitic violence. Seventy
                years and several liberation fights later, UNESCO's mandate is
                more relevant than ever. The purpose of UNESCO remains to
                reinforce the humanist purposes of education, research, and
                culture.

                campaign. Fridays for Future believes in peaceful, non-violent
                ways to let our national and state governments know of our
                demand to address the ongoing climate crisis and ecological
                breakdown in a world burdened by climate changes caused by
                unsustainable practises adopted by individuals and industries
                affecting all citizens. FF prioritises ecological contributions
                and resolutions in decision-making and advocates the same at the
                national level. It argues that, in the grand scheme of things,
                systemic reform will cause greater individual changes. They
                mostly use strategies such as climate strikes or marches, and
                Fridays for Future (FFF) India has carried out a number of
                activities in the last year across its 61 local chapters around

                Aarey" campaign and the statewide movement calling for the
                withdrawal of the EIA Draft 2020. Through research, information,
                education, webinars, speeches, and events, FFF India raises
                awareness of the climate issue and the need for climate justice.
                Campaigns are intended to raise awareness of significant changes
                that pose a threat to the environment, with the goal of
                educating people sufficiently to demand climate action.

                Values such as nonviolence and empathy are lacking in the
                educational diaspora. Conflicts, both personal and
                interpersonal, stay unsolved as a result, leading to their
                escalation and, at times, violence. As an individual grows up in
                such an environment, he or she loses the ability to perceive and
                appreciate diversity. Such an environment makes harmonious
                coexistence difficult. YPI is committed to offering innovative
                and long-term solutions to such 'Glo-cal' issues, as well as

                <br />

                for animals. PETA Youth places young people at the forefront of

                animal-friendly reforms in their schools, colleges, and
                communities to assisting them in leading the fight against cruel
                industries that harm animals. <br />

                PETA Youth approaches the fight against animal cruelty in a
                unique way, having a convivial and mirthful time while spreading
                the word about animal rights through rallies, flash mobs, and
                graffiti. They also make cruelty-free living simple by providing

              <p id="sec-gen-msg">
                PETA youth is PETA India's outreach programme for teenagers and
                young adults. It was created to empower, inspire, and assist the
                youth, who have the potential to make a significant difference
                for animals. PETA Youth places young people at the forefront of
                today's animal rights movement, from assisting them in enacting
                animal-friendly reforms in their schools, colleges, and
                communities to assisting them in leading the fight against cruel
                industries that harm animals. <br />

                PETA Youth approaches the fight against animal cruelty in a
                unique way, having a convivial and mirthful time while spreading
                the word about animal rights through rallies, flash mobs, and
                graffiti. They also make cruelty-free living simple by providing
                information on everything from vegan foods to 'how to avoid
                buying products that harm animals.' To top it all off, they
                collaborate with some of the most well-known college festivals
                in the country, including Sunburn, the Escape Festival of Art
                and Music, NH7 Weekender, and Strawberry Fields Forever Music
                Festival. <br />
