              It is a matter of great pride that Amity University Uttar Pradesh
              (AUUP) is organising the second on-line edition of Amity
              International Model United Nations (AMIMUN’22) on the theme
              “Perseverantia Omnia Vincit: Perseverance Conquers All” from
              Saturday, 22nd January to Sunday, 23rd March 2022. Overall, this
              is the 11th edition of AMIMUN. There cannot be a better theme of
              this year’s AMIMUN as it is imperishable “perseverance” which
              enables effulgent human spirit to always rise victorious in the
              face of any challenge or seemingly unsurmountable adversities.
              <br />
              World is passing through a very unpredictable phase where on the
              one hand, there are plethora of opportunities in futuristic as
              well as conventional areas, but on the other hand, it is beckoning
              you to take up cudgels and come up with solutions to challenges
              such as global warming and climate change. An amalgamation of
              young, bright and most innovative minds, AMIMUN is a platform to
              debate, brainstorm and deliberate on all such burning issues and I
              am confident that these ignited minds will come up with ideas,
              solutions, and suggestions to build a better future. With our
              belief in harnessing excellence in the field of innovative and
              adaptive education whilst keeping the holistic approach intact,
              Amity aims to consolidate AMIMUN’s worldwide recognition and its
              status as one of the top MUNs across the continent with the
              participation of delegates from across the world. <br />
              <span id="dots1">...</span>
              <span id="more1">
                The teaching philosophy of Amity particularly focuses on values
                and Sanskars and importantly, the understanding of close
                cross-cultural nuances. At Amity, the students are nurtured with
                such attributes in an environment that motivates analytical
                thinking on matters that concerns the humankind. AMIMUN caters
                the mission of Amity and further complements it by providing a
                representational prevue of United Nations functions and its
                deliberation on crucial global issues. AMIMUN'22 will provide an
                opportunity to the students to become familiar with global
                concerns and the working of the United Nations where the
                delegates will attempt to resolve regional and international
                problems in a powerful, yet engaging manner through debates,
                diplomacy and negotiations. It will prove to be a platform to
                commence an optimistic outcome for the world and the youth. As
                the leaders and changemakers of tomorrow unite at this
                conference, they will hone their skills of leadership, teamwork,
                expository and persuasive writing, debating and negotiations,
                and learn the significance of such traits to become successful
                professionals in future. All participants, from India as well as
                from diverse regions of the globe such as USA, UK, Canada,
                Russia, Canada, Australia, Germany among others, will find
                AMIMUN'22 to be a convention where their unique talents and
                capabilities will enable them to achieve professional growth.
                <br />

              I am pleased that (AMIMUN'22) is bringing together outstanding
              brains from India's and the World's top Universities, giving them
              a lifetime opportunity to observe the human spirit's ability to
              not only survive but also bloom in the face of adversity,
              particularly during the COVID-19 outbreak. <br />
              It is a conference that will create a learning environment,
              encouraging the young minds to bloom into able future leaders. The
              theme of AMIMUN’22 ``Perseverantia Omnia Vincit: Perseverance
              Conquers All,” brilliantly captures the pandemic's difficult
              moments as well as each individual's unwavering drive to thrive.
              Based on our belief in merging excellence in the field of
              innovative and adaptable education while retaining a holistic
              approach, we aspire to make AMIMUN'22 an experience that will
              uphold the mission of inspiring students to explore future ideas
              to alter the world for the better. AMIMUN'22 will be a forum for
              delegates to learn, understand diplomatic relations between
              nations, instil leadership qualities, and develop intellectual
              competence to be socially responsible, based on existing policies
              and procedures of organisations around the world. With delegates
              coming in from all around the world, we aim to consolidate
              AMIMUN's global recognition and status as one of the best MUNs in
              the continent. <br />

                I am certain that encouraging students to create and participate
                in such activities enlightens them with an idea of ‘staying
                rooted with the confidence that success is inevitable if one
                continues to make a concerted effort to attain it’. It not only
                develops future front-runners but also relentlessly pushes them
                to achieve victory and accomplish their desired goals. On the
                virtual platform, I welcome the distinguished guests to
                AMIMUN'22, and I am confident that they will serve as role
                models for the students attending the Conference. The delegates
                will acquire better skills from the shared knowledge and
                awareness. It would inspire the participants to learn the value
                of skills like strategic thinking and critical analysis, as well
                as the necessity of enthusiasm, humility, and compassion in
                their quest to make a significant difference to the world.
                AMIMUN’22 promises to be a conference of high repute owing to
                the sincere efforts of the devoted organizing members and the
                team of committed students. I extend my best wishes for
                AMIMUN’22 for a reverberating success and hope that it builds
                upon the foundation laid by its outstanding previous editions.

              It gives me great pleasure to share that Amity University Uttar
              Pradesh is organizing the second online edition of Amity
              International Model United Nations Conference (AMIMUN), on the
              theme:  "Perseverantia Omnia Vincit: Perseverance Conquers All''
              on 22nd and 23rd of January 2022. <br />
              With this motive of perseverance in our spirits, Amity has adapted
              to the COVID-19 pandemic with the latest technology, initiatives
              and methods to ensure that learning is not interrupted. AMIMUN’22
              is such an initiative, seeking to present a worldwide viewpoint
              through a space where the young assume the responsibility to rise
              from the myriad of issues and find a solution, constructing
              harmonious relations for security, social advancement, better
              expectations of the world and common liberties. <br />

              The United Nations is an organization that cannot be overlooked:
              in an anarchic world system. The UN brings together diverse
              members in an increasingly interdependent world to discuss,
              deliberate and end up at collective decisions, ensuring the
              opportunity for the unity of all. I ardently believe that these
              discussions and deliberations amongst the leaders of tomorrow pose
              to be the foundation stone towards edifying their contemporary
              minds, honing their already notable outlooks on diverse
              adversities. In this new normal, the international sphere has
              faced and overcome unprecedented arduous situations.

                At Amity, the students are nurtured and inclined towards
                meticulous solutions in matters concerning humankind. AMIMUN is
                a platform to transform learning to actual execution, with its
                worldwide recognition and proud status as one of the top MUNs
                across the continent.  A Model United Nations is a scholarly
                simulation of an actual United Nations conference, where the
                delegates assume the roles of state and non-state actors of the
                international sphere. By representing their allotments, the
                feeling of empathy and social responsibility, which comes
                undeniably with leadership, is inculcated in the students.  MUNs
                are student-led and oriented, providing students with indelible
                learning and leadership experiences, cultivating their diplomacy
                and negotiation skills.  By engaging in these, individuals
                develop leadership, research, writing, public speaking and
                problem-solving skills. <br />
                Through learning how to raise issues that even nations are
                unable to address, the participants are placed at the centre of
                the simulation of an organization to resolve global issues. A
                comprehensive understanding of a country’s foreign policy, the
                factors which influence its behaviour internationally, its
                background, history, treatment in the UN along with the previous
                resolutions passed on it will be instilled. Application of this
                comprehensive understanding will develop an astute analytical
                ability, allowing the participants to examine the concerns of
                their allotted country and that of the rest, past precedents as
                well as potential solutions to the designated agenda. As the
                physical borders are replaced by connections of the internet and
                accessibility, AMIMUN holds onto its belief in perseverance as
                it hosts varied participants from universities all around the
                world. I extend my best wishes to the delegates and wish them a
                great learning experience. Unequivocally, the hard work and
                marvellous commitment of the organizing committee members and
                the Secretariat will create a ripple effect, making AMIMUN’22 a
                spectacular success!  <br />
                Wishing all a very happy, healthy and prosperous new year! <br

              “Coming together is a beginning, keeping together is a progress
              and working together is a success” - rightly quoted by Henry Ford
              describes our utmost honour and enthusiasm to invite you all to
              this second e-edition of Amity International Model United Nations
              2022 (AMIMUN’22), which is the eleventh iteration of this
              Conference. AMIMUN has had an eventful history of zeroing in on
              issues justifying contemporary pertinence, which stems from
              leanings and discussions of the United Nations. Keeping in mind
              the phase of dynamic transformation which the entire World
              underwent during the pandemic; this edition of the conference will
              be embellished by the theme – ‘Perseverantia Omnia Vincit:
              Perseverance Conquers All’. AMIMUN is a unique platform which this
              Year aims to shed light on the indomitable human spirit to
              withstand and flourish in the face of unprecedented challenges as
              well as act as a catalyst of change for issues at large. The
              debates and discussions are focused on signifying the importance
              of training wherein the leaders of tomorrow take part in the act
              of making more astute arrangements, permitting them to convey
              waves of progress. <br />

                The overwhelming response that AMIMUN’22 has got and the
                appreciation for all its past editions speak volumes of sheer
                devotion and unwavering commitment to connect brilliant minds.
                We are sure that this Conference would provide one-of-a-kind
                experience to all delegates as we associate with stakeholders to
                provide better opportunities. The zeal to do better and provide
                an international platform that connects people from across the
                globe is what the team envisioned for AMIMUN’22. Delegates from
                more than 20 International Universities from countries such as
                USA, UK, Australia, Russia, Germany, and Canada would be
                participating in the Conference. Certain committees of this
                edition would be supported and led by International Executive
                Board Members. We have collaborated with UNESCO, Fridays for

              We are honoured to welcome you to the second e-Edition and the
              11th edition of Amity International Model United Nations
              (AMIMUN'22), which will take place on January 22nd and 23rd, 2022.
              We at AMIMUN'22 hope to organise a Model UN conference that brings
              together delegates from all over the world on the same forum and
              helps them showcase their persevering spirit in such trying times.
              <br />

              We at Amity work hard to make e-AMIMUN'22 an experience that
              upholds the mission of educating participants about global issues
              and promoting peace and work of the United Nations through
              cooperation and diplomacy. At Amity University, we always strive
              to go above and beyond in developing skills such as teamwork,
              leadership, expository and persuasive writing, debating and
              negotiation, which are important for personal development and
              future success. In this age of globalisation,I believe that
              learning about the world is more important than ever. Students
              will interact with people from various countries and backgrounds
              no matter what field or profession they pursue. Problems that
              occur halfway around the world have an impact on our lives, our
              country, and our communities. Students gain knowledge by preparing
              for Model United Nations conferences, representing countries other
              than their own, and presenting potential solutions to global
              problems in committees.  <br />

                AMIMUN'22 will serve as a springboard for a more optimistic
                future for the world and its youth. In this "learning by doing"
                approach, students roleplay as diplomats and world leaders and
                get to participate in the critical decision-making processes
                involved in the international affairs arena through the Model UN
                programme. This primary source engagement leads to a better
                understanding of global issues and the context in which they are
                negotiated and resolved. <br />

                I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to the
                Secretariat, Organizing Committee and all the volunteers of
                AMIMUN'22, who have worked tirelessly to steer this conference
                towards becoming an educational platform, providing
                opportunities for anyone interested in learning about the
                processes of international diplomacy. We hope that this
                conference will provide you with an excellent opportunity to
                challenge yourself and improve your professional communication
                and global acumen. With such capable people at the helm, I do
                not doubt that this will be a resounding success and a
                conference to remember. <br
