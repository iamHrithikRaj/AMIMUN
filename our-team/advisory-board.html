          The Amity International Model United Nations Conference is one of the
          biggest student-led conferences of Amity University, Noida. It has
          made an indelible mark for itself in the Indian MUN Circuit and
          Asia-Pacific MUN Circuit as among the best MUNs to attend in the
          region. Over the last 11 years, AMIMUN has set a benchmark in terms of
          the quality of debate as well as the quality of its execution. AMIMUN
          has a long list of achievers in various fields who have attended and
          learned so much from it. It is able to proudly boast of providing its
          participants with the best opportunity any MUN conference could offer.
          <br />

          My attachment with the AMIMUN dates back to 2018 when I participated
          as a delegate of the 8th edition of AMIMUN, which inspired me to one
          day reach the rings of leadership within it. I am blessed to have had
          the honour and privilege to hold the post of the Secretary-General of
          the first e-edition AMIMUN Conference in 2021. I have gained so much
          from the conference as a delegate and also as a Secretariat member. I
          owe AMIMUN a great deal for the organizational skills I possess today.
          <br />

          I am glad to know that AMIMUN is back with the second E-edition on the
          22nd-23rd January 2022. The Secretariat this year has chosen a very
          apt theme for the circumstances we are encountering at hand -
          Perseverantia Omnia Vincit. In these trying times of the COVID-19
          pandemic we have seen the struggles and have encountered ourselves the
          challenges the pandemic has brought forward, but through it all we as
          a global community, as a nation and as individuals have persevered
          through it all and today we are here in the cusp of history as the
          generations that are surviving a deadly pandemic. <br />

          Our world today faces many challenges and the disparity between the
          accessibility to rights of all individuals regardless of economic
          factors, age, gender or race is greater than ever. The global
          community together may fall short of their own Goals set to be met by
          2030, therefore it is very important that young people like us come
          forward and discuss global issues to understand them. An MUN is not
          just a platform of speaking but of in-depth research and analysis of
          the agendas at hand, therefore the more awareness we become of global
          issues the more prepared we are as a race to systematically solve such
          issues. I, therefore, invite young people throughout the globe to come
          and be part of the AMIMUN 2022. <br />

          I give my heartiest best wishes to Ms Shubhangi Thakur (Secretary
          General of AMIMUN’22) and her team to make this instalment a grand
          success and to break the barriers and benchmarks set by previous
          conferences. <br />

          Model United Nations conferences are verbal debates that are a clash
          of core ideas and their application to the real world. This focus on
          actionable change in MUNs is something I believe is especially
          important, as it lays a clear focus on problem-solving instead of
          abstract, principled debate. Due to this, delegates must focus on
          viable solutions, making it necessary for them to consider all angles
          and viewpoints of a problem, building on their problem-solving skills.
          <br />

          I have seen it all in AMIMUN, be it as an OC in my first year of
          college, leading the Delegate Affairs team in the second, to being the
          Charge D'Affaires of the conference during the 2021 e-edition. Behind
          the deliberation and discussion inside the committees, there is a
          massive team of students that work day and night for months to make it
          possible. <br />

          I know delegates coming in this year will have a great experience as
          well. Delegates are sure to enter a conference that nourishes them
          creatively, so they may progress. As an advisor, I will do my best to
          bring the best of all my experience through constructive suggestions
          to the team’s table. More importantly, I know that the Secretariat,
          and all of the Organising Committee will continue to diligently create
          a conference wherein each participant flourishes. From expanding their
          worldview to refining their skills as orators, AMIMUN’22 is sure to be
          a platform that fosters holistic growth in all individuals involved.
          <br />

          I wish the best of luck to Ms Shubhangi Thakur (Secretary General of
          AMIMUN’22) and her team who are working tirelessly to make this second
          e-Edition of AMIMUN a success. I wholeheartedly believe in them.

          Model United Nations, a platform based on the principles of the
          world's main peacekeeping entity, the United Nations, is a simulation
          of how this vast and altruistic organization operates. It is not
          simply a cacophony of impassioned dialogue, nor is it a tidal wave of
          numerous debates; rather, it is a clash of fundamental concepts as
          well as their implementation in the actual world. This aspect of MUNs,
          focusing on actionable change, is especially important to me because
          it places a clear emphasis on problem-solving rather than ambiguous
          debate. This emphasis on problem-solving distinguishes MUNs from other
          activities because it actively encourages the development of a broad
          knowledge base based on solid research and the development of clarity
          of action. <br />

          The Amity International Model United Nations has carved out a niche
          for itself in the domestic circuit as a conference, nay, a platform, a
          medium through which today's youth are empowered to pursue their own
          beliefs while being surrounded by the best in terms of hospitality and
          quality. Having served as the Secretary General for the 9th edition of
          this Conference, I was able to witness firsthand the long-term
          benefits of being a part of something much larger than yourself.
          During my time there, I learned what it meant to be a part of such an
          amazing team, a team that became family to me. <br />

          I am convinced that this edition will build on this immense legacy by
          becoming a fine example of excellent debate and discourse. I am
          confident that my juniors have orchestrated an amazing experience for
          all people involved. It is an honour and a privilege to welcome you
          all to the second e-Edition of the Amity International Model United
          Nations Conference, 2022. <br />

          of the conference, to the wide array of agendas that are incredibly
          pertinent to the current global atmosphere, the Secretariat and EB has
          already done their best to lay the groundwork towards constructing a
          productive conference. <br />

          I am truly honoured to serve on the advisory board of one of the
          country's largest MUNs, with students from all disciplines devoting
          their time to solving pressing issues. The conference, which is rich
          in experience and led by some of the best debaters on the circuit,
          aims to bring out the best in everyone involved and promotes the
          values of the United Nations while working toward a better future. Any
          delegate, reporter or caricature artist is certain to benefit from the
          rich discussion and open atmosphere AMIMUN provides, allowing
          individuals to step out of their comfort zones and grow as delegates.
          <br />

          Through working with my colleagues, I endeavour to make certain we
          reach the goals we have set and create a safe learning environment for
          all. I extend my best wishes and support to the entire team for the
          upcoming AMIMUN 2022 conference. <br />

          While the United Nations is our best hope for a peaceful and free
          world, Model UN has emerged as one of the most powerful platforms for
          connecting ground-breaking ideas proposed by brilliant young minds in
          this rapidly changing world. And I am honoured to be a part of
          AMIMUN's legacy, which is one of the most prestigious conferences on
          the MUN circuit. <br />

          I've seen it all in AMIMUN, from being a delegate in my first year of
          college to being an OC member in my second year, leading the marketing
          team in my third year, and eventually becoming the conference's
          Director General in the AMIMUN 2020 edition. As someone who has been
          intimately involved in the inner workings of this Conference, I can't
          help but feel that AMIMUN itself is a testament to the tenacity and
          indomitable will of the Secretariat, as well as all the other members,
          because behind the two days of deliberation and discussion in the
          committees, there is a large team of students who work around the
          clock for months to make it possible. <br />

          AMIMUN teaches you life skills, such as how to handle various critical
          situations and how to manage people in order to achieve a common goal,
          which is to have the best conference by far every year. The delegates
          arriving this year will have the opportunity to put themselves in the
          shoes of UN ambassadors, acting as global citizens while drafting
          resolutions, plotting strategy, and negotiating with both allies and
          adversaries. As an advisor for the second E-edition of AMIMUN, I will
          do everything in my power to assist the team in incorporating novel
          methods and experiences to ensure that this edition is a resounding
          success. <br />

          "AMIMUN isn't just a conference, it's an emotion," my senior used to
          say. Model United Nations is a life-changing experience that I have
          firsthand knowledge of. Using this platform, one can learn how to
          inscribe their own vision into a collective belief of an intellectual
          group of people. Model United Nations is an excellent way for young
          people to learn about the world and problem-solving. We must be
          willing to collaborate with people of all ages and backgrounds as
          future world leaders. <br />

          I've had the pleasure of working in AMIMUN for three years and have
          seen how it has helped me grow on every level of my being. This
          prestigious conference has been a fantastic experience for me, both as
          a delegate and as a member of the Organizing Committee. My time as
          Secretary-General instilled in me the values of discipline, duty, and,
          most importantly leadership. While the Secretariat and Organising
          Committee is no doubt currently quite capable, I am certain that
          through this experience they will forge themselves into better, more
          experienced individuals. This will lead to a conference that will
          certainly be in a class of its own. <br />

          Due to this, I strongly encourage young orators to participate in
          AMIMUN 2022 and take advantage of the fantastic opportunities it will
          provide, especially this year when we should all be thankful. The
          second e-edition of AMIMUN is to be a place of fruitful debate and
          discussion, wherein delegates and reporters alike will be exposed to a
          multitude of ideas, allowing them to organically broaden their
          horizons, and improve upon the core set of skills required to excel at
          MUNs. Beginners and experienced orators alike, will certainly be
          benefitted by the exchange that will take place at AMIMUN’22,
          especially due to the high quality of debate ensured by the EB
          members. I, too, will work with my fellow advisors, making certain
          that any changes we postulate add to the calibre of the conference. I
          wish the best for the entire AMIMUN'22 Organizing Team and
          Secretariat! <br />

          It takes a lot of courage to take the stage and present one's views in
          front of one's peers, share one's ideas, and push forward with zeal
          for what one believes in, and yet delegates are able to display such
          blatant courage whenever the opportunity arises. These reenactments of
          the United Nations Diaspora have the same effect on the brain of a
          young ambassador as a way to deal with strategy and the assurance of
          global support for peacekeeping. The Amity Model United Nations is a
          wonderful opportunity for young people to see how the world works and
          how it deals with its troubles. <br />

          During my tenure at AMIMUN, I was surrounded by a community of capable
          individuals that consistently improved upon their wide array of
          abilities. As Director General, I had the honor of watching this group
          of individuals come together and add to the long legacy we were a part
          of. To now be a part of the Advisory Board this year, gives me the
          opportunity to bear witness once again to the magic that takes place
          behind the well assembled conference. As a member of the Advisory
          Board and the AMIMUN'22 team, I am confident that AMIMUN will be a
          fine demarcation of the Delegates' capacity to influence the debate,
          and that the Delegates will benefit from this exceptional conference.
          <br />

          Throughout the history of AMIMUNs, each iteration has been a step
          above the last, with each team learning and improving on the insight
          passed down. I have unshakeable faith in this year’s team as well,
          knowing without doubt that the Organising Committee is led by an
          exceptional Secretariat. For all these reasons, it gives me great
          pleasure to invite you to the next installment of this prestigious
          conference. <br />
